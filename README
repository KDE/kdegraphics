          allows you to access your camera's picture with the URL kamera:/

              picker

This package also contains two more general libraries:

* libkscan: library to access scanners used by kooka (and koffice), needs
            SANE to be used

Common Mistakes
---------------

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of latest Qt 3.x version.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.

More Info
---------
