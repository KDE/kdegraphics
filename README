Common Mistakes
---------------
If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.trolltech.com
to get a copy of latest Qt 3.3.x version.


Debugging
---------
You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs. This will ensure useful and more 
verbose backtraces, but will require a lot more disk space. 


More Info
---------
Please direct any bug reports to our bug list by visiting
http://bugs.kde.org.

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
